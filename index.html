    <h2>A collection of ideas and web apps by me, John.</h2>
    <p>To begin with, I will brush up on my HTML/CSS knowledge, before looking at Javascript.</p>
    <p>Following on from these, I will then look at programming languages such as Python (to learn about making bots etc...)
       and Ruby (most often used in making web apps).
